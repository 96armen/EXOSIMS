\section{Introduction}

The exoplanet direct imaging simulation code generates ensembles of mission simulations for exoplanet direct imaging missions to estimate science yields. The code consists of stand-alone modules written in Python which may be modified without requiring modifications to other portions of the code. This allows the code to be easily used to investigate new designs for exoplanet direct imaging missions. This document describes the required input/output interfaces for the stand-alone modules to enable this flexibility.

\subsection{Purpose}
This Interface Control Document (ICD) describes the interface between modules of the code. The data inputs and outputs of each module are described. Following these guidelines will allow the code to be updated to accommodate new mission designs.

\subsection{Scope}
This ICD defines the interfaces between modules of the code. It does not specify the contents of the individual modules beyond a general description of what each module does.

\subsection{Glossary}
This section will contain definition of terms used throughout the document if needed.

% OVERVIEW
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Overview}
The overall framework of the exoplanet direct imaging mission simulation code is depicted in Fig.~\ref{figure_framework}. The code framework consists of stand-alone modules. The fundamental inputs of the simulation may require external data. These include the Optical System Description (OSD), Star Catalog (SC), Planet Population Definition (PPD), Planet Physical Model (PPM), Observatory Definition (OD), Rules, and Post-Processing (PP) modules. The other modules used in mission simulation require a combination of the fundamental inputs as well as modules upstream in Fig.~\ref{figure_framework}. These include Target List (TL), Simulated Universe (SU), Survey Simulation (SS), and Survey Ensemble (SE) modules.

\section{Global Specifications}
This section specifies important information shared throughout the code.
\begin{description}
    \item[Common Epoch] \hfill \\ J2000
    \item[Common Reference Frame] \hfill \\ Heliocentric Equatorial (HE)
    \item[Common Time] \hfill \\ Modified Julian Day (MJD $\triangleq$ JD - 2400000.5)
\end{description}

\subsection{Python Packages}
The following Python packages are used for the WFIRST-specific version of exoplanet mission simulation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item astropy
        \begin{itemize}
            \item astropy.time
            \item astropy.units
        \end{itemize}
    \item numpy 
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% BACKBONE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Backbone}
All simulation execution will be performed by the backbone.  This set of functions will have very limited built-in functionality, and will primarily be tasked with parsing the input specification described below, and then calling the specified instances of each of the framework modules, detailed in \S\ref{sec:modules}.

A simulation specification is a single JSON-formatted (\url{http://json.org/}) file that encodes user-settable parameters and module names.  The backbone will contain a reference specification with \emph{all} parameters and modules set.  In the initial parsing of the user-supplied specification, it will be merged with the reference specification such that any fields not set by the user will be assigned to their reference (default) values. 

The backbone will contain a standalone specification parser that will check specification files for internal consistency.  For example, if modules carry mutual dependencies, the specification parser will return an error if these are not met for a given specification.  Similarly, if modules are selected with optional top level inputs, warnings will be generated if these are not set in the same specification files.

The backbone will contain an interactive function to help users generate specification files via a series of questions.

\section{Modules of Fundamental Inputs}\label{sec:modules}
Modules containing fundamental inputs include Optical System Description (OSD), Star Catalog (SC), Planet Population Definition (PPD), Planet Physical Model (PPM), Observatory Definition (OD), Rules, and Post-Processing (PP).
